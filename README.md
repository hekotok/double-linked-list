# double-linked-list
 The `doubly-linked-list` module is a JavaScript library that provides a versatile and efficient implementation of a doubly linked list data structure. Doubly linked lists are used to manage a collection of elements where each element (node) contains a reference to both the next and previous elements in the list.
